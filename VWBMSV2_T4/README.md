Teensy 4.0 version of SimpBMS for VW battery modules.
Not pin compatable with Teensy 3.2 as pin 22, 23 are now used for CAN ( moved to pin 3 , 4 ) and Serial2 is now on pins 7 and 8.
ONLY tested on one Golf GTE battery module. Battery CAN read/write and gauge pwm function correctly.
Outlander charger added but untested ( as are all the other charger options )
